       <center><h2> WHO ARE WE? </h2></center>
        <p> Relationships and Sexual Education Preservation Project, otherwise known as RSEPP believes that the current RSE guidelines should remain in place. We are an independent student-led awareness group that aims to create social action by opposing the new government. Our community is our biggest focus and the nation as a whole. RSEPP was founded by Wellington East Girls' Year 13 students who study Level 3 Sociology for NCEA. RSEPP is not only a coalition but a group that is willing to bring forward education resources that we have researched and gathered aimed at students due to the potential lack of resources soon to be provided to students related to sexual education. If you are interested in these resources, please visit our resources pages. As a group, we believe that relationship and sexuality education matters in NZ, especially as members of the youth and students ourselves, this education is especially crucial to the younger generation. A well-informed and educated generation is the future of our NZ society. We must do what we cant do so to ourselves and our community. </p>
