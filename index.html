       <center><h2> WELCOME TO THE RELATIONSHIPS & SEXUALITY PRESERVATION PROJECT </h2></center>
        <p>Welcome to our RSEPP home page, this website is a guide to Relationships and Sexual Education, with many resources to help students learn more about sexuality, relationships, genders, reproductive systems and so much more. RSEPP wants to ensure that students around Aotearoa New Zealand remain well-educated and informed about relationships and sexuality, given that the new government aims to remove current RSE policies. From a group of students to you, we want to help. 
We think that there should be nothing put in place instead and the current RSE guidelines should remain the same because it would prevent the discrimination and exclusion of minority groups’ in our NZ society. It is in our best-interest to look out for the needs’ of our current-day generation and by replacing the current RSE, it would be taking a step backwards. You've helped us out a bit more by just clicking on our link! </p>

       <center><h3> What is the issue? </h3></center>
         <p> In New Zealand the new government is planning to remove and replace the current guidelines for relationship and sexuality education. With the change in government, New Zealand First promised in their election manifesto to “Refocus the curriculum on academic achievement and not ideology, including the removal and replacement of the gender, sexuality, and relationship-based education guidelines.” This means adequate education on gender and sexuality will not be provided and this could affect those in the LGBTQIA+ community.

       <center><h4> Current RSE Policy </h4></center>
         <p> The current policies related to relationship and sexuality education were released in 2020. The Ministry of Health describes these policies as ​​"focusing strongly on consensual, healthy and respectful relationships as being essential to student wellbeing". Though 2018 research figured out that most schools have gaps in their sex education, especially around consent and relationships. Current policies state that a child’s parent or guardian is allowed to withdraw their child from sex education. The current RSE policies teach students a range of topics including reproductive systems, gender, sexuality, contraception, and much more. RSE is taught through primary to high school and ranges from less serious topics to more serious topics to fit an age-appropriate education. </p>
