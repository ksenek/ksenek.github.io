       <center><h2> So what really is relationships and sexuality education? </h2></center>
        <p> It provides students with the knowledge and skills they need to develop healthy relationships and make informed choices that support their mental and physical health and wellbeing. Research shows that when young people have quality relationships and sexuality education, they are more likely to delay having sex, and use condoms and contraception when they choose to have sex. More recently, relationships and sexuality education have been linked to a broader range of positive social and health outcomes, including promoting healthy relationships and preventing sexual and intimate partner violence.

Relationships and sexuality education teaches young people that in society, people hold a range of identities and perspectives, including identities related to gender, ethnicity, language, and religion. It incorporates mātauranga Māori and other cultural perspectives. Relationships and sexuality education supports young people to think about the diverse world around them, and how to be respectful of differences. We all want young people to feel that they belong and to be accepting of others. This is important learning for young people throughout their lives – in their intimate relationships, but also in
friendships, among whānau and workplace relationships. Schools have a responsibility to ensure all young people feel safe and included at school, including young people who are gender diverse. Conversations about gender diversity are happening online, and in the media. Evidence-based learning about these issues in school, alongside conversations with parents at home, helps young people make sense of what they are encountering online. Young people want to learn about a broad range of issues related to sexuality and relationships. We can confirm this. </p>

     <center><h3> Currently </h3></center> 
      <p>Relationships and Sexuality Education is taught through years 1-10. Schools have flexibility around the content and delivery of their Relationships and Sexuality Education. The way Relationships and Sexuality Education is taught is determined by the school that’s teaching it. The Ministry of Education provides Guidelines to support schools with their programme. Schools must consult their community every two years on the implementation of the health education curriculum — including their Relationships and Sexuality Education delivery.
Quality Relationships and Sexuality Education celebrates the diversity of rangatahi, their whānau, and their communities. Quality Relationships and Sexuality Education supports rangatahi of all genders, sexual orientations, abilities, cultures, ethnicities, and religions. </p>

     <center><h3> So? </h3></center>
      <p> There are many benefits of Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE). National and global evidence shows that quality RSE is effective. Recent studies show that most parents in Aotearoa support RSE in schools — and that rangatahi want to learn about RSE in schools.Unfortunately, many rangatahi feel that their schools don’t deliver the quality of RSE that they need.</p>

      <center><h3> What is the issue? </h3></center>
      <p>In New Zealand the new government is planning to remove and replace the current guidelines for relationship and sexuality education. With the change in government, New Zealand First promised in their election manifesto to “Refocus the curriculum on academic achievement and not ideology, including the removal and replacement of the gender, sexuality, and relationship-based education guidelines.” This means adequate education on gender and sexuality will not be provided and this could affect those in the LGBTQIA+ community. </p>

      <div>
     <center><h3>What do we think?</h3></center> 
      <p>This issue affects students, youths, families and teachers. The change of legislation will affect those mentioned in society. Students will no longer learn about consent education or healthy relationship education, resulting in little to no knowledge around this. This can impact the way students treat their partners and how their partners treat them. Students may not be able to recognise what's not okay in a relationship, which can lead to students becoming stuck in unhealthy relationships. This change also affects families of youths. For example, the new legislation means that parents have all the control over what their children learn about. They can allow their child/children to not attend lessons, if they don’t want them too. This can also impact families with strong religious beliefs, therefore resulting in their children opting out of more lessons because what is taught does not align with their views. The new legislation can also impact sexual education teachers because the curriculum will change, meaning that they will have to alter the way that they teach, additionally learning a new curriculum which will also change their approach to how they deliver the information to students. It will not only affect sex ED teachers, it will affect all teachers because they will have to be wary of how they discuss topics regarding sexual education in their other classes. For example, social sciences, health education, PE and English.

     <center><h3>What do we believe should be in place?</h3></center> 
      <p>We think we should keep the guidelines introduced in 2020 which “focuses strongly on consensual, healthy and respectful relationships as being essential to student wellbeing. This learning, along with mental health and drug and alcohol education, safety and violence prevention, and food and nutrition, are all part of the Health and Physical Education component of the New Zealand Curriculum.” the new proposed curriculum wants to remove all “gender ideology”. “Gender ideology refers to a system of belief that holds that there is a difference between sex and gender and to a spectrum of beliefs that practically deny the significance of bodily sex for personal identity. This may take the form of a distinction between sex as biological and gender as a social construct.”
